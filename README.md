# madlibs

This is the 1st addition of a series of projects where I gradually learn to use Python and create more complicated projects.

Mad Libs is a fairly simple game in which multiple words of specific types are provided and then used in a preset sentence template.
This is an exercise in saving user inputs as variables and using them in print statements.
